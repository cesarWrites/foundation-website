            <p>Since the foundation of the George Kithi Foundation, we have made a difference in the lives of hundreds of families and individuals. We have brought hope to students who would otherwise have been driven out of school through bursaries and scholarships. Our empowerment initiatives have raised awareness and the availability of vital services, while our community health initiatives have empowered families to develop stronger, sustainable livelihoods.
            Every success we achieve is a testament to what can be done through cooperation, compassion, and shared responsibility.</p>
